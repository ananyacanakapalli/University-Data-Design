# University-Data-Design-Project

### Problem Statement

The university's data analytics and architecture team faces significant challenges due to the current hybrid infrastructure, which combines cloud and on-premise solutions. The system struggles with data reconciliation, standardization, and scalability, hindering the university's ability to rapidly implement new features and conduct advanced analytics.

Key issues include:
- **Archaic Infrastructure**: The existing mix of cloud and on-premise applications creates difficulties in managing data effectively.
- **Data Silos**: Data is scattered across various systems, making it challenging to obtain a unified view and apply predictive analytics.
- **High Maintenance Costs**: A significant budget is spent on maintaining and patching old data sources and integrations.
- **Complex Data Processing**: The diverse data processing techniques and technologies used contribute to inconsistencies and inefficiencies.
- **Security and Governance**: Ensuring data security and governance is critical, given the university's growth and increasing data volume.

The goal is to establish a design for: 
- Unified data access and storage 
- Prepping data for downstream processes, removing irregularities in data.
- Scalable data ingestion and extraction 
- Data security
- Easy of hooks for integration 
- Optimal storage usage for different use cases
- Cost efficiency without reducing the Effectiveness of the use cases.
- Scalability in overall design to accommodate future business growth
